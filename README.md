# UScensus dataset analysis for Dataiku interview
 
## Goal

The goal of this study is to create a model that will automatically determine, thanks to census data, if a person has an income of more or less $50K per year.

## Files

The data files are stored into the directory `data`, the detailled instructions are explained into the markdown file `instructions.md`, all the output images are stored in the directory called `images`. And the most important: the file with the analysis is `report.md` (in french sorry).
